<!--
The position Property
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

static (default)
relative
fixed
sticky
absolute

An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special 
way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the 
page:

An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to 
its normal position.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a 
relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away 
from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to 
fit into any gap left by the element.

An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the 
viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if 
the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties 
are used to position the element.


An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the 
user's scroll position.


position: absolute;
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to 
the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative 
to the viewport, like fixed).

However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned 
ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page 
scrolling.
